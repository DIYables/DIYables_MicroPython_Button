"""
This MicroPython library is designed for any hardware plaform that supports MicroPython such as Raspberry Pi Pico, ESP32, Micro:bit... to make it easy to use push button, momentary switches, toggle switch, magnetic contact switch (door sensor)..â€‹.. 

It is created by DIYables to work with DIYables products, but also work with products from other brands. Please consider purchasing products from [DIYables Store on Amazon](https://amazon.com/diyables) from to support our work.
